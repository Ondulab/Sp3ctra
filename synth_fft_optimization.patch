--- Optimizations for synth_fft to reduce CPU load while maintaining quality ---

1. **Adaptive harmonic count based on note frequency**
   - High notes: fewer harmonics needed (they're naturally bright)
   - Low notes: more harmonics needed (for richness)

2. **Smart amplitude processing**
   - Skip harmonics with very low amplitude 
   - Use threshold to avoid processing inaudible harmonics

3. **Optimized FFT processing rate**
   - Reduce FFT calculation frequency for less critical parts
   - Use interpolation between FFT frames

4. **Voice allocation optimization**
   - Prioritize voices to reduce simultaneous processing

5. **Buffer optimization**
   - Ensure synth_fft doesn't starve synth_ifft buffers

These changes will allow 96kHz to work smoothly with full harmonic content.
